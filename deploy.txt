1. Create web.config for React Router
Place this file in your build output folder (dist or build) before deploying:

2. Build Your Project
Output will be in dist or build folder.
Copy web.config into this folder.
3. Manage .env Variables
Do NOT include .env in your build or upload. Instead, set these variables in Azure Portal:

Go to your Web App in Azure Portal.
Click Configuration (under Settings).
Under Application settings, click New application setting for each variable in your .env file (e.g., VITE_AZURE_CLIENT_ID, etc.).
Save and restart your Web App.
4. Deployment Options
Option A: ZIP Deploy (Manual)
Zip your build output

Compress the contents of dist or build (including web.config) into a .zip file.
Upload via Azure Portal

Go to your Web App > Deployment Center > ZIP Deploy.
Upload your .zip file.
Restart your Web App

Go to Overview > Restart.
Option B: FTP Deploy
Get FTP Credentials

In Azure Portal, go to your Web App > Deployment Center > FTP.
Copy the FTP hostname, username, and password.
Upload Files

Use an FTP client (e.g., FileZilla).
Connect and upload the contents of your build folder (including web.config) to /site/wwwroot.
Restart your Web App

In Azure Portal, click Restart.
Option C: GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
Push your code to GitHub.

In Azure Portal:

Go to your Web App > Deployment Center > GitHub.
Authorize and select your repo and branch.
Azure will create a workflow file in your repo (e.g., .github/workflows/azure.yml).

Configure build steps in the workflow file if needed:

Ensure it runs npm install and npm run build.
Add a step to copy web.config to the build output.
On push, GitHub Actions will build and deploy automatically.

5. Verify Deployment
Visit https://<your-app-name>.azurewebsites.net
Test navigation (React Router should work).
Check environment variables are loaded (test authentication/API calls).
Summary
Build your project and add web.config for React Router.
Set .env variables in Azure Portal, not in your code.
Deploy using ZIP, FTP, or GitHub Actions.
Restart and verify your app.
